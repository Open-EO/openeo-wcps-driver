/*
 * OpenEO API
 * The OpenEO API specification for interoperable cloud-based processing of large Earth observation datasets. **This early draft version is incomplete and intended for working on a prototype and a proof of concept.** Things that are currently missing particularly include:   * Authentication and authorization with OAuth 2.0,   * how results of computations can be downloaded,   * how data is streamed into UDFs and how the output of UDFs is returned,   * how services are organized as microservices,   * how payments can be handled,  * how resources (e.g. process graphs) can be shared,  * and how OpenSearch is interfaced
 *
 * OpenAPI spec version: 0.0.2
